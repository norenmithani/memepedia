After our analysis, synthesis, and surveys, we were able to fully break down our understanding of memes and the relationship between people and memes. Why do people like memes? What is the most common way to use memes? Who is the ideal type of person to look for memes and effectively use them?  The personas definitely helped to put things into perspective in regards of comprehending the culture of memes. In hindsight, the content we extracted from our interviews and surveys was very important so that we could go more in depth by constructing personas, journey maps, and user stories. Also, since we made journey maps and user stories, we became a lot more empathetic and questioned the simple things that meme users go through. It's almost like each of us are attempting to become the most useful designer or salesperson for our product before it even exists. \n\n\n","attribs":"*4*5*6+9*4|1+1*4*6*8+2a*4|1+1*4*6*9+2a*4|1+1*4*6*a+2a*4|2+2*4*5*6+d*4|1+1*4*6*b+2a*4|2+2*4*5*6+i*4|1+1*4*6*c+2a*4|2+2*4*5*6+i*4|1+1*4*6*d+2a*4|2+2*4*5*6+ea*4*6+2l*4*5*6+5*4*6+2c*4*5*6+7o*4|1+1|2+2","opCount":27,"appliedAttribsCount":54,"maxAttribsOnSingleOp":3},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.4fz9s4pIrvcRKF5l"],"1":["align","left"],"2":["insertorder","first"],"3":["lmkr","1"],"4":["author","2361703607"],"5":["font-color-000000","true"],"6":["font-size-medium","true"],"7":["removed","true"],"8":["link-MTU1MTI0MTU0ODE4OS1odHRwczovL3JlYWx0aW1lYm9hcmQuY29tL2FwcC9ib2FyZC9vOUpfa3lUTU5FUT0vP21vdmVUb1dpZGdldD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ2NDQ4NzA2NDE0","true"],"9":["link-MTU1MTI0MTU2MDQ4Mi1odHRwczovL3JlYWx0aW1lYm9hcmQuY29tL2FwcC9ib2FyZC9vOUpfa3lUTU5FUT0vP21vdmVUb1dpZGdldD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ2NDQ4NzA2NDIx","true"],"10":["link-MTU1MTI0MTU3MjA2Ny1odHRwczovL3JlYWx0aW1lYm9hcmQuY29tL2FwcC9ib2FyZC9vOUpfa3lUTU5FUT0vP21vdmVUb1dpZGdldD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ2NDQ4NzA2NDIy","true"],"11":["link-MTU1MTI0MTU4NDUzOS1odHRwczovL3JlYWx0aW1lYm9hcmQuY29tL2FwcC9ib2FyZC9vOUpfa3lUTU5FUT0vP21vdmVUb1dpZGdldD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ2NDQ4NzA2NDI0","true"],"12":["link-MTU1MTI0MTYwNDU5MS1odHRwczovL3JlYWx0aW1lYm9hcmQuY29tL2FwcC9ib2FyZC9vOUpfa3lUTU5FUT0vP21vdmVUb1dpZGdldD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ2NDYzNTc0MzUw","true"],"13":["link-MTU1MTI0MTYxNzI2Ny1odHRwczovL3JlYWx0aW1lYm9hcmQuY29tL2FwcC9ib2FyZC9vOUpfa3lUTU5FUT0vP21vdmVUb1dpZGdldD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ2NDc4NjAwNjA4","true"]},"nextNum":14},"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[]}
